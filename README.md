# HANDCRICKET

**Overview**

The Hand Cricket game is a virtual recreation of the popular street cricket game where two players (human vs computer) alternately act as the batsman and bowler. The batsman scores runs until their input matches the bowler's input, at which point they are considered out. This project is implemented in Java.

**Features:**

* Turn-based Gameplay: Players take turns in batting and bowling.

* Run Scoring: Runs are scored based on the player's input.

* Wickets: A player is out if the inputs from the batsman and bowler match.

* Computer AI: Play against an artificial opponent.

**Gameplay Rules:**

* The player enters "head" or "tails" for the toss.

* The one who wins the toss choses to bat or bowl and also decides the number of wickets.

* Players take turns acting as batsman or bowler.

* As the batsman, a player enters a number (typically 1-6) to score runs.

* As the bowler, a player enters a number (typically 1-6) to match the batsman's input.

* If the batsman and bowler's numbers match, the batsman is out.

* The roles reverse after all out, and the new batsman attempts to beat the previous score.

**Prerequisites:**

* Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or higher.

* Text Editor/IDE: Any Java-supporting environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).

**Setup Instructions:**

* Clone or download the repository.

* Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

**Compile the Java file:**

javac HandCricketGame.java

**Run the compiled program:**
